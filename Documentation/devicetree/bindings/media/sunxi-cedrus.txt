Device-tree bindings for the VPU found in Allwinner SoCs, referred to as the
Video Engine (VE) in Allwinner literature.

The VPU can only access the first 256 MiB of DRAM, that are DMA-mapped starting
from the DRAM base. This requires specific memory allocation and handling.

Required properties:
- compatible	        : "allwinner,sun4i-a10-video-engine";
- memory-region         : DMA pool for buffers allocation;
- clocks	        : list of clock specifiers, corresponding to entries in
                          the clock-names property;
- clock-names	        : should contain "ahb", "mod" and "ram" entries;
- assigned-clocks       : list of clocks assigned to the VE;
- assigned-clocks-rates : list of clock rates for the clocks assigned to the VE;
- resets	        : phandle for reset;
- interrupts	        : should contain VE interrupt number;
- reg		        : should contain register base and length of VE.

Example:

reserved-memory {
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	ranges;

	/* Address must be kept in the lower 256 MiBs of DRAM for VE. */
	ve_memory: cma@4a000000 {
		compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
		reg = <0x4a000000 0x6000000>;
		no-map;
		linux,cma-default;
	};
};

video-engine@1c0e000 {
	compatible = "allwinner,sun4i-a10-video-engine";
	reg = <0x01c0e000 0x1000>;
	memory-region = <&ve_memory>;

	clocks = <&ccu CLK_AHB_VE>, <&ccu CLK_VE>,
		 <&ccu CLK_DRAM_VE>;
	clock-names = "ahb", "mod", "ram";

	assigned-clocks = <&ccu CLK_VE>;
	assigned-clock-rates = <320000000>;

	resets = <&ccu RST_VE>;

	interrupts = <GIC_SPI 53 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
};
